# COVID19-optimal-model-algorithm-selection-with-DMM-SAW
This is my final project to take bachelor degree in computer science (informatics). I develop 5 model algorithm (Backpropagation, Recurrent Neural Network, SVM Linear, SVM Non-Linear (RBF), and Naive Bayes. The most optimal algorithm model is determined using Decision Making Methodology SAW.
